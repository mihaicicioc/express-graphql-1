## Simple GraphQL project

We use the libs:
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql)
- [graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql)

We don't use a database for this simple example. The data is hardcoded and is taken from the file `data.js`.

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm start
```

If everything is ok, you should see this in yous console output:
> Server ready at http://localhost:4000/

Open that url in your web browser.
